Never use var, always use explicit types.  Never have multiple returns from a function instead prefer nested conditions where the successful cases come first and failures are the else cases.  Do not use emojis or unicode characters anywhere.  Never delete a file and try to rewrite it if the edit tool is not working, just try calling the tool again or stop and tell me it isn't working and summarize the operation you were about to perform.  Don't use Linq.  Use ANSI bracing format.  Line up variable declarations and names visually so it's easier to read.  Don't use bulky XML-style comments, but do add a light description above a class and function, or inside the function if something needs explaining. Fix all warnings if you can.  I like using nullables properly, and if async methods aren't async, remove the keyword and return Task.FromResult()
